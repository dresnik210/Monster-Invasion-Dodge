# Game Design Document

## Part 1

The primary "things" I will have are a user controlled "hero" and five different types of "monsters."

The hero and each type of monster will look different through the use of PixMapItems.

The five types of monsters are as follows:
  *`1.` Bombers: big monsters that move straight down at a slow pace
  *`2.` Rockets: small monsters that move straight down at a fast pace
  *`3.` Swervers: medium sized monsters that zig zag as they come down the screen
  *`4.` Flyers: medium sized monsters that come down in a stair pattern
  *`5.` Bouncers: medium sized monsters that come down at a medium pace and bounce back up once after hitting the bottom of the screen
  
## Part 2

The game will use the left and right arrows keys to move the player's character from side to side to avoid getting hit by the various monsters coming down the screen.

## Part 3

The score only goes up. It increases by one when a monster is successfully avoided.

## Part 4

The player dies when the "hero" character gets hit by a monster. The player only has one life so once they get hit a single time the game is over.

## Part 5
